### Why OOP?
Deals with the complexity of large software systems. As programs grow in size and complexity it becomes very difficult to maintain. One small change at any point in the program can trigger a ripple effect of errors due to dependencies throughout the entire program. 

Programmers needed a way to create containers for data that could be changed and manipulated without affecting the entire program.

There comes the concept of OOP. OOP encapsulates the data and their manipulation methods into a single unit called class. This class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object can also be termed as an instance of a class.

### Encapsulation
The idea of bundling or combining the data and the operations that work on that data into a single entity, e.g., an object.
